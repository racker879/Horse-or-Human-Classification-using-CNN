# Horse-or-Human-Classification-using-CNN
Problem statement :
Classifie given image is horse or human 

Solution :
To Solve this Problem we used Deep Learning Algorithm is CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

We created two models :
In 1st model we get 96.11% training accuracy with validation accuracy 85.54%
In 2nd model we get 92.89% training accuracy with validation accuracy 76.56% (using learning rate = 0.01)
